# Greyhoundx
A fork of Greyhound modified by me, the Call of Duty Asset Extractor.

# What's new
* A switch to change the unit of exported models and animations.
* Disable windows maximum path length limitation. (Best to use on windows10 and windows11.)
* Modify the hash table reading method of mw2022 to adapt to mw2022 hash table.
